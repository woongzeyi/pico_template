# pico_template

## Howto use

Step 1: "Use this template" and give it a nice name, something like "my_pico_spaceship_project"

Step 2: Wait a few moments before cloning as GitHub is baking your repo. (this is considered a step, period)

Step 3: Clone your freshly baked repo, and execute `make` to initialize your project (make sure you have make installed). This is required everytime you clone your project. 

Happy coding :D!
